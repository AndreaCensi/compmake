Compmake: you need it but you don't know it yet
===============================================

**Compmake** is an unobstrusive Python library that provides 
Make--like facilities to a Python application, including:

- Minimal effort job management and **parallelization** 
(multiple CPU on a single host, cluster computing using SGE, 
and experimental support for cloud computing using Multyvac).
- **Caching** of temporary results: you can interrupt your program 
and restart it without losing what was already computed.
- **Failure tolerance**: if a job fails, other jobs that do
not depend on it continue to be executed.
- A **console** for inspecting failures and partial completion,
with familiar commands such as ``make``, ``clean``, etc.

Changelog
---------

* v3.4.1 - Bug fix; experimental multyvac_sync
* v3.4.0 - Changed the way that dynamic job IDs are generated 
           to avoid a race condition in a corner case.
* v3.3.7 - Bug fix.
* v3.3.6 - Experimental Multyvac backend.
