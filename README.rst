**Compmake** is a non-obtrusive module that provides:

* ``make``--like facilities to your Python computations
  (``make``, ``clean``, etc.), including caching of temporary
  results (that is, you can interrupt your program, and
  restart it without losing (much) data.) 

* A console for inspecting failures and partial completion. 

* Single-host (using the ``multiprocessing`` module) and
  multiple-host parallelization (using ssh-spawned slaves). 
  
* Peace of mind!

See <http://compmake.org> for documentation.
