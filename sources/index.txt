Compmake: keep calm and carry on
================================

.. raw:: html
   :file: index-logo.html

|compmake| is a non-obtrusive module that provides Makefile--like facilities to your Python computations, including:

* **Familiar commands** such as ``make``, ``clean``, etc.

* Zero-effort **parallelization**.

* **Caching** of temporary results: you can interrupt your program (CTRL-C), and restart it without losing what was already computed.

* A **console** for inspecting failures and partial completion.

|compmake| has been designed primarily for handling long computational-intensive
batch processes. It assumes that the computational layout is fixed and that 
all intermediate results can be cached to disk. If these two conditions are met,
you can use |compmake| to gain considerable peace of mind. Read :ref:`why`.


Installation
------------------

The simplest way to install |compmake| is::

$ easy_install compmake

or, alternatively, using ``pip install compmake``. You can also `fork the project on GitHub`_.

.. _`fork the project on GitHub`: http://github.com/AndreaCensi/compmake

..

     :file: download.html

.. 
    This will allow you to run |compmake| on a single host.
    However, there are also separate dependencies to install for some
    advanced features such as multiprocessing. See :ref:`install` for more information.

Basic usage
------------

To use |compmake|, you have to minimally modify your Python program,
such that it can understand the processing layout and
the opportunities for parallelization.

.. image:: my_static/initial.png 
   :class: bigpicture

Download `a demo example.py`_ that you can try.

.. _`a demo example.py`: static/demos/example.py

You would run the modified program using::

    $ compmake example -c make            # runs serially


**Parallel execution**: To run jobs in parallel, use the ``parmake`` command::

    $ compmake example -c "parmake n=6"   # runs at most 6 in parallel

There are all sorts of configuration options for being nice to other
users of the machine; for example, Compmake can be instructed  
not to start other jobs if the CPU or memory usage is already above a certain 
percentage::

    $ compmake --max_cpu_load=50 --max_mem_load=50 example -c "clean; parmake"


..
    $ compmake example -c clustmake  # runs on a cluster

**Console**: Moreover, by running ``compmake example`` only, you have access to a
console that allows you to inspect the status of the computations,
cleaning/remaking jobs, etc.

**Selective re-make**: You can selectively remake part of the computations. For example,
suppose that you modify the ``draw()`` function, and you want to
rerun only the last step. You can achieve that by::

    $ compmake example -c "remake draw*"

|compmake| will reuse part of the computations (``func1`` and ``func2``)
but it will redo the last step.

**Failure tolerance**: 
If some of the jobs fail (e.g., they throw an exception),
compmake will go forward with the rest. 

To try this behavior, download the file `example_fail.py`_. If you run::

    $ compmake example_fail -c "parmake n=4"

you will see how compmake completes all jobs that can be completed. If you run again::

    $ compmake example_fail -c "make"

Compmake will try again to run the jobs that failed.

.. **Note**: |compmake| is currently a **beta release**:
.. while most of the functionality is there,
.. the documentation is not complete,
.. it is a bit rough around the edges,
.. and some minor aspects of the API could change in the future.
.. If you feel adventorous, this is a perfect time to
.. get support and influence |compmake|'s evolution!
