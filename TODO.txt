TODO

* Finish writing documentation.

* Peter's  comments:

1. The css for the commenting popup on the LHS of the screen is shown
partly hidden under the left edge of the screen.
2. The comment popup looks a bit ugly (buttons outside of the
background box etc). (Both of these issues observed in Chrome)
3. Markdown formatting seems broken for
http://compmake.org/install.html#install as I can see "##"'s instead
of sections.
